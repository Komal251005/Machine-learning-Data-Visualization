#Overview:

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Data Visualization techniques using Python.
Each notebook explores different concepts, such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visual insights.

#Contents:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and patterns using matplotlib and seaborn.

Model Building: Implementing and comparing various classification and regression algorithms using scikit-learn.

Model Evaluation: Analyzing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Visualization: Creating insightful charts and plots for better understanding of datasets and model results.
